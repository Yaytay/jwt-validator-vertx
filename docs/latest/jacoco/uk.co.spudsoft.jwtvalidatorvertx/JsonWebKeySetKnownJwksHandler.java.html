   * 
   * Each JWKs endpoint must use KIDs that are globally unique.
   * 
   * When a KID is requested and cannot be found ALL the configured JWKS URLs will be queried and the single cache will be updated.
   * Entries in the cache will be retained for a duration based on either the Cache-Control max-age header of the response or, 
   * if that is not present, the defaultJwkCacheDuration.
   * Given that only positive responses are cached it is reasonable for the defaultJwkCacheDuration to be 24 hours (or more).
   * 
   * @param webClient Vertx WebClient instance, that will be used for querying the JWKS URLs.
   * @param jwksUrls Static set of URLs that will be used for obtaining JWKs.
   * @param defaultJwkCacheDuration Time to keep JWKs in cache if no cache-control: max-age header is found.
   * @return a newly created instance of the implementation class.
   * 
   * The JWKS URLs must be accessed via https for the environment to offer any security.
   * This is not enforced at the code level.
