/**
 * Validate JWTs.
 * 
 * There are two approaches that can be used for finding the keys necessary to validate the signature:
 * <UL>
 * <LI> The caller passes in the issuer, the validator performs OpenID Discovery to find the JWKS URL and then finds the keys from there.
 * <LI> The configuration of the validator specifies a number of JWKS URLs.
 * </UL>
 * <p>
 * The former configuration is appropriate when used in a SAAS application with many issuers, each of which has it's own JWKS.
 * If the validator is not being used in a SAAS application, or the issuers in a SAAS application share keys, then the second
 * approach is a lot more memory efficient.
 * <p>
 * An instance of JwtValidator can only support one of these two models, determined by the JsonWebKeySetHandler that it uses (and you probably only want one JwtValidator in your service).
 * <p>
 * When a dynamic configuration is used the issuer acceptability must pass three steps:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>The issuer passed in to the JwtValidator must be non-null and acceptable.
 * <LI>The issuer found in the token must be non-null and acceptable.
 * <LI>The issuer passed in and the issuer in the token must be the same.
 * </UL>
 * <p>
 * With a static configuration the passed in issuer is optional, and thus the first and last steps may be skipped.
 * If an issuer is passed in to a static configuration all three steps will take place.
 * <p>
 * There are circumstances in which a client will want to use a static JwtValidator, but also to use the {@link OpenIdDiscoveryHandler}.
 * This is OK, but the caching of JWKSs will not be shared between the two sides because there is a fundamental difference in requirements between the two.
 * When the OpenIdDiscoveryHandler is used to find JWKs the key IDs are specific to the issuer, but the static configuration requires all key IDs to be globally unique.
 * <p>
 * The WebClient passed in to create the JwtValidator does not have to be dedicated to it.
